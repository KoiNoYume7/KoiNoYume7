A powerful Star Citizen tool designed to optimize cargo trading, ship usage tracking, and mining output.  
ANNIK-A is all about **efficiency meets immersion** — with 3D cargo grid visualizations, game.log parsing, and station-aware loadout logic.  
Coming soon: mining output optimizer that avoids storage mismatch problems most tools ignore.

> Tech: Python, Flask, Open3D, custom logic parsing, planned API integrations (UEX, Regolith, etc.)

## 📚 Current Focus

- Learning clean **software architecture** through real-world projects  
- Finally getting into the **Linux world** (NixOS) after being a win11 kiddy
- Improving **communication & leadership** with my **Medrunner** org in Star Citizen  
- Evolving my sci-fi/fantasy story **Noxitorian Dreams** into a full narrative universe

## 🌌 Personal Projects & Passions

- 🚀 **Star Citizen Medrunner (Since Dec 2024):**  
  Tactical evac missions, logistics planning, and the occasional “oops-all-chaos” moment.  
  Roles: Pilot, support, soon-to-be team lead — I like my ops clean and efficient.

- ✍️ **Noxitorian Dreams (Since Sep 2023):**  
  A deeply symbolic worldbuilding project exploring emotion, broken angels, and moral complexity.  
  Think cyberpunk meets fantasy with a poetic core and characters based on real inner values.

- 💻 **Tinkering with tech**:  
  It is not just about developing with code, but also with hardware. I expand my knowledge all around the topic.
  
- 📁 **Structured Chaos**:  
  I always liked keeping things modular and meaningful. Now I took it to the next level. Documentation and structure has become a part of me instead of chaos and destruction. This has been a big step foreward for me.

### 🐾 Bonus Fact

I don’t just build things — I build **experiences**.  
Whether it's a rescue mission under fire or a floating music player with pixel-perfect vibes,  
I care about **how things feel**, not just how they function.
